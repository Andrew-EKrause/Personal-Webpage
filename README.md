## Description
**_Personal Website to Help Showcase my Skill Set_** <br/>
This project is my first personal webpage that was published online through the use of GitHub Pages. I designed the webiste using HTML and CSS. My personal webpage contains information about my education in Computer Science, my hobbies, and some of my programming skills. I also have a "Contact Me" section near the bottom of the page for any employers interested in contacting me to discuss job opportunities or internships. Links to my GitHub portfolio, my LinkedIn account, and a Curriculum Vitae website are included toward the bottom of the page. I intend to keep the personal webpage up-to-date on my skill set as well as my educational status.
